#### About me

At the beginning of 2023, I decided to try my hand at IT, as I have been interested in website layout for the last 2 years. Now I am actively developing in frontend development and studying new technologies.
In 2024 I graduated from PGNIU in the direction of ‘Media Communications’, as a diploma work I made a website for a photographer.
